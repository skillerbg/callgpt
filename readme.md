# CallGPT - Browser Extension (Manual Installation)

CallGPT is a browser extension that allows you to mimic a real voice conversation with OpenAI's GPT-4/GPT-3.5-turbo. By providing your OpenAI API key, you can engage in a voice call experience with an AI right from your browser. Your API key is securely stored in your browser's storage and is not accessible by anyone else.

**Important Note:** The extension is written in manifest v2, and the Chrome Web Store no longer accepts v2 extensions. Rewriting it for v3 would compromise its user-friendliness. Therefore, this extension can only be installed manually.
